      "bio": "I started out coding simple websites in HTML and CSS, then I picked up JavaScript and have been using a variety of frameworks for building fast, mobile-first, and responsive web/mobile applications. I am also passionate about blockchain technology and decentralization and really like the suite of tools that enable developers to host fast, modern, and censorship-proof sites/apps on the open web. I've been coding for around 5 years and enjoy learning new technologies and their potential impact on our world and its people. While I'm not coding/studying, I like to read/research, lift weights, and listen to music.",
